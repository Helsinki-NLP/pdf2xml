pdf2xml - convert PDF files to XML
----------------------------------

This script heavily relies on Apache Tika for the conversion.

What does it do more than Apache Tika?

- it tries to put words together that have been separated into character sequences
- it tries to merge hyphenated words

How?

- use pdftotext to generate text files and combine results
  --> standard mode: puts hyphenated words together in many cases
  --> raw mode: is better in keeping words together (instead of producing character sequences)
- use Apache Tika to produce XHTML and use information from pdftotext to merge characters
